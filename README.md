##Description:
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
##How to Play:

Use the **arrow** keys to move the player across the board. To win you need to reach water, but avoid colliding with the bugs.
